The most challenging part is remembering you are on a new branch. 
It feelds like something to overlook then you forgoet to commit to main.


Through this experience, I learned the importance of pull requests in collaborative work. 
They serve as a structured way to propose changes and facilitate discussions about the modifications before merging them into the main branch.
