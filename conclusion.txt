What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
The most challenging part of this assignment was creating Pull Requests. The process of ensuring proper 
branch management and understanding the workflow of code reviews took some time to get accustomed to.
What is one element you learned about Git and GitHub through this experience?
I learned how to create branches in Git, stage and commit changes, push them to a remote repository, 
and initiate pull requests to contribute changes to a collaborative project.
