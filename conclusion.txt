- what is the most challenging part of this assignment?
answer: keeping up with the filenanmes and my working directory. It took me longer than ideal for me to\
figure out what branch I was working in and which files I needed to open/edit/submit. This is a personal\
issue since there were only a handful of files in the directory for HW2 pulled from github, but definitely\
something I want to improve on. 

-what is one element earn about git an GitHun though this experience?
answer: one element I was able to learn was how making changes on the local device wont affect the file
in GitHub until I actually use git add. Its nice that copies are made to the local device and I'm free to
manipulate them idependently to my liking before adding the changes to the original file. Even then with \
git add, the changes still have to be accepted through merging.
