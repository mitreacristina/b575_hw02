What was the most challenging part of this assignment? Surprisingly navigating Git Hub, now that I'm more familiar with the terminal.
I need to practice using Git Hub more often.  

What is one element earn about git and GitHub through this experience? All I know up to this point I have learned in this class. I have never used 
Git Hub or the bash terminal previuosly.I like the version control aspect of Git Hub, and I think it is very useful for working in large teams.
