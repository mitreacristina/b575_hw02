â€¢ What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
Overall part 1 of the homework was more challenging to me than part 2.
I wasn't used to writing pseudocode before this assignment, which thought me to translate a typical python codes to descriptive words.
From part 2, requesting a pull was new for me, which was sllightly more challenging compared to editing files or adding new files under git.

â€¢ What is one element earn about git and GitHub through this experience?
I learned to push a branch (sequence_analysis) without merging it with main, showing git's capabilities of independent editing.
