What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
  For me, it was writing the pseudocode. It's somehow harder for me to write code with no language, but I eventually got it.
What was one element learned about git and Github?
  I've never really had to interact with anybody else's repository, so it was interesting for me to fork, branch, and pull request for the first time.
