PROBLEM 1 QUESTION 6:

a) In 2-3 sentences, explain why identifying specific patterns in DNA is 
important for biological research.

Identify specific patterns is important to understand if something has changed in the DNA sequence 
(site directed mutagenesis or bisulfite sequencing) or for identifying a site of expected enzyme 
binding that may direct a certain molecular behavior.

b) In 2-3 sentences, describe how the frequency of your 
custom pattern might affect its biological role.

The frequency of the pattern can infer on the experimental role or biological of the sequence entered into the example dna. 
For example, if it appears once in a short or twice in an experimental context we can infer that it is used as target for 
a restriction enzyme experiment or it will get translated into a selectable marker for  a protein. In a biological context, 
we could infer that the sequence is a TF site or start/stop codon depending on the length of gene for the particular expression.


PROBLEM 2 QUESTION 6:

What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

Visualizing the forked directories from and getting 
used to order operations for saving changed to Github repositories.

What is one element you learned about git and GitHub through this experience?

I accidentally deleted my repo access token text file. Now I know how to regenerate a token, 
but it guarantees there will be consequences in the future.
