What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
I feel that this part is not very challenging. Even though I haven't used Git Hub before, 
I believe that this system will be very interesting and efficient.

What is one element earn about git and GitHub through this experience?
I will not mess up anything since I will always have the back up copy. 
But I need to keep in mind that I need to save my work locally.
