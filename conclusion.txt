The most challenging part of this assignment for me was creating pull requests. 
Ensuring that I correctly pulled the repository and writing the description part were a little confusing. 

One element I learnt about git and GitHub through this assignment is how to effectively use branches to manage different changes in a project. 
Learning how to push and pull the repository and creating a new branch for the sequence analysis allowed me to develop the new script independently from the main branch.
