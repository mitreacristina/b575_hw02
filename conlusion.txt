# - The most challenging part of this assignment was remembering all of the different git commands. For this reason,
# going back through the notes was really helpful in remembering how we used git in class. Specifically, the staging,
# committing, and pushing changes was something I had forgotten how to do. 


# - This experience helped me learn how to visualize what is happening when we make changes to git repositories, and 
# also how to visualize how branches and forks off an original repository works. Something that I think is interesting
# is how much git can be used for, before using it in BASH I did not really fully grasp what the purpose of git was,
# but I now understand its purpose and usefulness.
